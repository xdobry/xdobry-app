>First task is to fix all bugs and improve user usability.
The other is to develop really new ideas.
Xdobry could serve as a basis for the development of different DB-applications.
With XOTcl development too Xdobry can be customized and extended for own needs.&#13;</P

>As the smallest denominator for relational databases standard SQL-92 and mysql was chosen.
Many of the problems were solved in SQL99 standard.
It remains for the moment to wait to the available RDBMS support this standard.
Interesting the implementing of object-relational qualities of the popular databases Postgres could be.
Many of those cover themselves with standard SQL3.

2 interesting projects also exist to the description of the GUI interface as XML-documents.
One comes of it as a by-product of the development of Open Source Netscape (Mozilla).
It is XPToolkit (<A
HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe</A
>
), the user's interface can independent of platform as XML-documents (user's interface XUL XMl Language).
Another project comes with the editor for the development of GUIs GLADE<A
HREF="http://glade.pn.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://glade.pn.org</A
>.
It is a part of the GNOME project, free desktop Enivronment for LINUX.
The idea with both projects is that the appearance of the GUI is not party-coded in the program, but is always present as a XML-document.
This could allow a better and flexible configuring of the interface by the used without must to recompile the program.
Both projects are all the more valuable that the complete source are free and can be applied the available components also with foreign projects.
The development of <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>FormEditor</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>FormServer</B
> could profit from it.</P
><P
>There also exist other interesting colleges of technology which are connected with XML-standard.
By the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) the transformation can be automated by XML-documents in other XML-classes or other formats.
So one could realize transformation of the Repository in specific SQL-instructions (the type CREATE TABLE) easily.</P
><P
>The main disadvantage the DTD (Document Type Defintion) is no context-systex can be covered.
With DTD can not be guaranteed a well-shaped Repository also a valid relational schema represents.
The newer developments like XML-schema allow a more exact definition of the document-types and overcoming such disadvantages.</P
><P
>Another direction for the advancement of the system would be the support of other abstractions and semantics in <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SchemaEditor</B
> and afterwords with the form-server.
Two cases are conceivable here: 1.
the system an interface offers for the addition functions the DBMS like versioning, new data types, DB-rule (Trigger) 2.
The system implements even new functional characters like versioning, Authentiefizierung, integrity rule, cascading delete.
For the conceptual model the support of other abstractions would be possible: derived attributes, derived relations, dependent relations (e.
g.
, an assistant can only in the project participant if he the special qualifications has).
, representation and manipulation of the tree structures which are filed as tables.</P
