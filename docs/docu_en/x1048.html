>However, the main advantage is a new way of developing the DB-forms.
The tables themselves do not place the basis for the forms but special the conceptual model.
The conceptual model is won by reverse engineering from databases schema (Data Dictionary).
The forms have so better quality and do not need of agile adaptations as with conventional systems.
The foreign keys are represented as listsboxes.
The inheritance is supported directly.
Embedded forms are possible.
The developing and use of forms was separated (It is always almost done by different people).
Thereby it use very few resources.
More of it in the underlying dissertation.</P
